		All artwork is made with the highest quality archival materials and methods. Paintings on gallery-wrapped stretcher frames or cradled panels have hand-finished edges, and are suitable for display "out of the box". Larger detail photos of the paintings are available upon request. Inkjet prints are made with archival pigment inks and papers, are hand-signed, numbered, and dated, and include a certificate of authenticity, and a half-inch border for framing. Prints, drawings, and paintings on paper should be framed for long-term care and protection. All framing is the responsibility of the purchaser.
