		I grew up in an idyllic country setting, surrounded by woods, fields, and a river in the back yard. My youthful obsession was bird watching, and all my early paintings were bird portraits. I learned the basics of watercolor from my mother; we were an artistic family, always tramping about, collecting specimens to sketch. Drawing and painting became the natural expression for this joyful existence.

		With the exaltation of my childhood, my constant feeling was- there must be some hidden intelligent force behind this beautiful Life. I wanted to paint this feeling. Later on, I came under the spell of various alternative spiritual ideas and visionary artists, and together with an abiding love of nature, the main direction of my painting was influenced and set in this fashion.

		As I see it, my work is about the invisible connection we have with that force. The basic emphasis is to treat the figure as fluid, receptive energy engaged in ritual concert with the elements. I imagine this as an experience where the sense of personal separation is relaxed and transformed by a ceremonial interaction with the living landscape. And thus, contact with the primal source becomes possible- and with it, a renewal of vitality, clarity, peace, and harmony.
