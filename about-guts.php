		Like most children, I marveled at the endless variety of living things, and the ever-changing patterns of the elements. My heart was often filled with the beauty of this earth, and over time, I became convinced there must be a grand design behind creation; the workings of something vast and mysterious beyond the appearance of things.

		It was an inspiring challenge to try to illustrate this feeling. I wanted to demonstrate these sensations as vital and real, and yet apart from the life of our everyday concerns. Thus, it was a natural impulse to begin by painting the landscape of dreams and visions- to make visible a magical space existing outside of time.

		For me, the story of these images is meant to suggest a liberation from the boundaries of the physical, to a new perception of nature. Alone, in an environment uncharted and yet somehow familiar, the actors in these dramas encounter a world filled with the possibilities of a vibrant and fluid energy. They are intended as portraits of the inner life associated with an adventure into the unknown.

		I think, in a basic way, these paintings not only represent my own experience, but are also interpretations of a larger historical theme: the quest for insight and illumination. My intention is to symbolize this transformation, which is perhaps the result of a simple commerce between nature and the longings of the human spirit. In the end, I hope to suggest the influence of this fleeting  moment, where the darkness is revealed as light, and the heart is filled with wonder.
