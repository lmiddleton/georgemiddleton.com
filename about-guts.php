	The theme of my artwork arises from the belief that this world is divine, active intelligence in origin and substance, and we are on a journey of return to pure waters..<br />
	As a person, my natural desire is to experience life as joyous, sublime, flowing, and magical. From practicing yoga, I know that as silence gains ground within, this return to innocence and clarity becomes possible.

	The act of painting for me has always been a celebration of this transformation. I try to depict this by imagining the figure as fluid energy in nature, where static boundaries are relaxed- where the sense of personal separation is dissolved in a positive, ceremonial interaction with the world. My intention is to emphasize this aspect of the self which is both universal and historical: our relentless and passionate struggle for connection, harmony, and an understanding of the true nature of things.

	My sources of inspiration and pictorial references include drawing and photographing nature and the people I know and love, and the influences of many artists and cultures old and new. I greatly enjoy the craft and technical aspects of painting- the sheer pleasure of making something with my own hands. I hope the end result is a beautiful physical object which becomes like an icon; a living, breathing repository of these feelings of love and aspiration.

	<strong>Materials and process: </strong>I usually work in series, primarily with acrylic polymer emulsion on panels or canvas, or with watercolor. For more complex pieces, the process begins with pencil and wash studies, and progresses to full color digital explorations as the painting develops. Sometimes I use collage and image transfer techniques, or work directly on top of an inkjet print underpainting. Conversely, some of my inkjet print editions start with scanned artwork. Others are entirely digital from start to finish, or are faithful reproductions of original paintings.
