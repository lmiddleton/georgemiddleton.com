		I work from the long history and tradition of artists inspired by spiritual experiences, religious ideas, and a love of nature. Finding ways within representational painting to suggest or evoke this aspect of the human experience is the main exploration, the main challenge of my practice.

		I think there has always been an active and deep yearning in people for connection- to go inward and seek transformation through prayer, meditation, devotion, or ritual movement. By imagining the figure- the person- as a fluid force of energy in ceremonial concert with the elements, I aim to suggest the divine impulse, this relentless pressure of the spirit.

		Painting for me is like a celebration- an action of return to innocence and clarity. <br />
		Indeed, I love the craft, the decorative expression, and the technical issues of painting- the sheer pleasure of making something of quality with my own hands. I strive to create the beautiful object, an icon imbued with these feelings..
